+++

Around 15 years ago at the age of 14 I visited Ndejje where a friend introduced me to working with glass. This creative form of recycling bottles interested me so much that I wanted to learn more than just the basics. After University classes and several  international workshops I transformed my passion into a profession. Everyone who knows me associates me with dancing, which has been my first love. My friend Arthur and I began working with the people of Katanga slums and Jackson. While teaching dance we instructed interested locals how to cut and decorate used glass bottles. Last year I had the opportunity to collaborate with Afrika Arts Kollective as a creative designer and main teacher of their classes.
